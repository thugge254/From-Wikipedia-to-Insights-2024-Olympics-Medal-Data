🏆 Who Really Dominated the 2024 Olympics? A Data Story from Web Scraping

For the last few days, I built a Python web scraper to collect medal counts from the 2024 Summer Olympics Wikipedia page.
After cleaning and organizing the data, I noticed something surprising:
•	The USA had the most gold medals (42), but
•	China actually had the highest total medal efficiency, earning more medals per athlete sent than any other top country.
•	Smaller teams like New Zealand and Jamaica punched far above their weight in gold medal ratio.
I visualized the results in this donut chart to show the proportion of gold medals vs other medals for the top 10 countries.
📊 Takeaway: Success isn’t just about the total medal count, efficiency matters, and smaller teams can outperform giants.
